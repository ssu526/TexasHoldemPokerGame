# Texas Holdem

This is a simplified version of the poker game "Texas Holdem". There's only one player and every time the player bets, the computer bets the same amount.
There are three stages in the game:
* Stage 1: 
  * The three flop cards will be shown. The player can choose to bet or discard the cards.
  * If the player discards the cards, the game ends.
  * If the player bets, the player continues to the next stage.
<br/>

* Stage 2: 
  * The turn card will be shown. The player can choose to bet or discard the cards.
  * If the player discards the cards, the game ends and the player losses the chips that he bet in stage 1.
  * If the player bets, the player continues to the next stage.
<br/> 
 
* Stage 3:
  * The river card will be shown. The amount that the player bets at this stage has to be greater than or equal to the previous bet. If the number of chips that the player has left is less than the previous bet, then the player has to go all-in at this stage. 
  * After the player bet, the game ends and the winner will be determined.
